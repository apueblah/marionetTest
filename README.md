# marionette-scaffolding
  
  marionette-scaffolding a fairly simple web application skeleton(boilerplate or whatever you want to call it) using [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) in combination with [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) and few other helpful libraries. I also put the minimal [Node](http://nodejs.org/) server for testing the web app. It's meant to be a helpful starting point for new web projects.

  I started off by creating [backbone-scaffolding](https://github.com/nilgradisnik/backbone-scaffolding) and eventually upgraded the project using Marionette
  
## Web app

  The `public` folder containes all the files that will get you started

## Server

  The `server` folder contains simple Node.js server. You'll find more info on how to run in and install dependencies there
